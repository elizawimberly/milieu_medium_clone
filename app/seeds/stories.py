    title = "Why Giotto Is the Father of Renaissance Painting",
    content = "Since the Renaissance a majority of sculpture and painting in Europe has endeavored to represent their subject matter naturalistically. Paintings were supposed to be windows onto another world, although usually a beautified and idealized one. To make a long story short, during the nineteenth century increasingly artists became disenchanted with the arts status quo. Artists like the Impressionists began to experiment with what else a painting could be besides a naturalistic portrayal of a scene.\n\nThe art movement that we call Modernism is rooted in this desire to push past traditional representation, but some artists pushed this experimentation further than others. In 1917 French artist Marcel Duchamp introduced the first ready-made,” a prefabricated urinal that he signed and titled Fountain and submitted to the Society of Independent Artists exhibition.\n\nThis, obviously, made a lot of people quite angry. The Society, which had previously stated that they would display any work submitted by an artist, refused to place the urinal on display. But what is even more important is that it introduced the idea that the thing that mattered when considering whether something was art was the artist’s intention.\n\nThis core concept has been used to justify a significant amount of art in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. Ready-mades, Dada, performance art, multimedia art, installation art, conceptual art, video art and more proliferate because the art world has internalized the notion that art is what the artist says is art.\n\n(It’s worth keeping in mind that ready-mades and conceptual art were not financially successful when they were first introduced, it took decades for this kind of art to be accepted, and even now these mediums are less financially successful than traditional paintings.)\n\nSo, the avant-garde changed everything and totally democratized the art world, right? Well, not exactly.\n\nPart 3: The Avant-Garde and the New Status Quo. The avant-garde has called into question the very notion of a “real artist.” They de-emphasized certain requirements that had traditionally defined an artist, like that you had to study at one of the official academies, or exhibit at official art salons. But this did not result in art world anarchy, new forms of education and exhibition arose to take their place.\n\nMany modernists became teachers themselves, whether in art academies or in universities. Some had quite experimental ideas about what arts education could be, leading to the formation of institutions like the Bauhaus school in 1919 or Black Mountain College in 1933.\n\nThese institutions changed the things that were taught in these schools, often emphasizing the exploration of form, new techniques to make art relevant to modern life, and encouraging the development of personal style rather than just copying the Old Masters. More recently the rise of the MFA, or Masters of Fine Arts, also provided another avenue to educate the next generation. Part of this is learning new techniques, but it is also about getting connected to the right people through your professors and the school’s reputation.\n\nSo while education changed, and there are more opportunities for non-formally educated artists to get a foothold in the art world, the avant-garde did not banish its importance entirely.\n\nThe other major component that the avant-garde changed but did not dissolve was the importance of exhibiting at the right places. While exhibiting at the Salon was no longer necessary, new forms of galleries and museums quickly took over. These new galleries took on an important role in representing the artists’ interests to a world that was slow to understand their achievements (and slower still to buy their work.)\n\nInstitutions that specifically celebrate modern and contemporary art, like the Museum of Modern Art, remain coveted spots for exhibitions and retrospectives. They are “career-defining” in a way not dissimilar from how success at the Salon would be career-defining for an artist one hundred years prior. And since they were still being sought out, the art world remained elite and exclusive.\n\nPart 4: The Industry. The arts industry that grew up during the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries has become a multi-billion dollar market. The industry is notoriously difficult to break into, and fickle even when you have broken in. The industry chases money around, and the institutions within it have become very defensive of their piece of the pie.\n\nDealers and galleries invest a lot, and potentially risk a lot, when taking on a new artist. They pay for the space to exhibit their work, the promotional materials, the photography, the shipping and display, the outreach to clients and more.\n\nSo when a gallery or auction house is considering a work of art, there are “quality control,” filtering, and gatekeeping procedures meant to protect their stakes. While many art collectors have particular tastes and can be quite selective, they also rely on their chosen dealers or art advisors to help them make solid decisions while collecting. If a gallery is seen to be offering “just anything” then they have no discernment, and they lower their value within the market. The wealthy art world clientele values exclusivity and rarity, they don’t want to buy what everyone else can easily have. They want to be told that their artwork is important and valuable, by someone with reliably good taste (and yes, many of them look for investments.)\n\nAn artist cannot just march into a high-status art auction house and offer whatever they like to auction. Gallerists and dealers today try to sift out the meaningful conceptual work from whatever they deem to be nonsense, a system which is both bolstered and refined by critical and art historical response.\n\nSo, there is actually a lot of work by “pretenders”, but the gallerists and dealers narrow the field by rejecting things that do not meet their standards. This bottleneck is what makes the art world an elite (with all of the elite’s preferences and prejudices.)\n\nPart 5: The (Real) Artists.What makes any new artist successful is a combination of blisteringly hard work, clever strategy, and dumb luck. (And relying on previously existing connections helps, nepotism has a long history in the art world.)\n\nAs hinted above, many artists still undergo some sort of formal training in an academy or university, which gives them time and space to create, some instruction, and connections. They’ll also be joining a horde of other artists trying to catch the eye of the notoriously picky gallery/curator/dealer market that I’ve already discussed. Having exhibitions in the right galleries, and jumping dealers to get better representation and percentage of the sale, will determine a lot of their career outcomes. Their chances of success are extremely small, and the rates they’ll be able to charge for their work at first will likely not reflect their investment of time and material costs.\n\nAnd what about creating these sorts of so-called easy art, like conceptual art, abstraction, etc.? Well, in my experience, the “easier” an artwork is to create in material-terms, the more effort has to be put in on the back-end to sell it. Not only that, but most artists who were famous for their conceptual work created other kinds of work beforehand — Duchamp was a painter, for example. To have success in conceptual mediums relies partly on your preexisting reputation as an artist.",

    title = 'The Nine-Act Structure of Feature Films',
    content = "At the heart of the Nine-Act Structure is the Two-Goal Structure. Ninety-nine percent of all feature films are either single-goal or two-goal. In both these story types, something (usually bad) happens, and something must be done.\n\nIn a single-goal film, it’s clear what must be done, and either a) the right person for the job does the job or b) the wrong person for the job does the job. Or, he/she fails, in which case it’s a tragedy. Either way, I call this a linear plot. A classic example is Nemo. Nemo is the protagonist. Once he is picked up, his goal is to get back home. There are many obstacles, but eventually he finds his dad and goes back to his beloved reef. Most Bond films are linear. Jaws was linear. Cast Away is linear. Mission Impossible 5 is linear, though several other MI films are not. The goal of the protagonist of a linear story is to put the world back the way it was before. Generally, he is changed in the process.\n\nThe original Star Wars story is interesting. You might think there are two goals: 1) get the droid to the rebel base, then 2) go destroy the death star. But Leah has laid everything out in her hologram speech at the beginning: bring the droid to the rebel base, where the rebels will look for a weakness they can exploit to destroy the death star. Luke knows that bringing the droid to the rebels is just the first half of the mission. This story has many two-goal attributes but is in fact linear.\n\nIn a two-goal film, the hero believes her first goal is the right solution to the current problem, but in fact it’s a trap. This is often referred to as the false goal. Sometimes, she actually attains it, but most of the time she stops short, because she learns what’s really going on and needs a new goal to save the day. Occasionally the hero achieves the second goal and dies in the effort (e.g., Braveheart) — it’s still a triumph.\n\nIn a feature film, there can be at most one false goal. I can only name one film with two false goals — Predator — and I hope it remains the only one, because there’s no room in 110 minutes for three goals and two reversals.",

    title = 'Max Ernst — The Master of Surrealism',
    content = "Max Ernst (1891 –1976) was a German painter, sculptor, graphic artist, and poet. A prolific artist, Ernst was a primary pioneer of the Dada movement and surrealism. He had no formal artistic training, but his experimental attitude toward the making of art resulted in his invention of frottage — a technique that uses pencil rubbings of objects as a source of images — and grattage, an analogous technique in which paint is scraped across canvas to reveal the imprints of the objects placed beneath. He is also noted for his novels consisting of collages.“Ernst is most closely associated with Surrealism, an artistic and literary movement in Paris in the 1920s that prized the irrational and the unconscious over order and reason. A key contribution to this movement was his invention of frottage, a technique of placing paper over a textured material, such as wood grain or metal mesh, and rubbing it with a pencil or crayon to achieve various effects. The Surrealists prized this practice — which produced compositions like Forest and Sun — for both the serendipity of the resulting imagery and the passivity it encouraged, bypassing the constraints of the artists rational mind. Having little control over the resulting patterns, Ernst marveled that he “came to assist as spectator at the birth of all my works. Eventually, he translated the method from paper to painting, using the word grattage to describe this technique of scraping wet paint off of the canvas to achieve similar patterned effects.",

    content = "My 9-year-old son, Owen, had long ago been indoctrinated by the entrepreneurial spirit. I don’t remember how it all started, but now he owns stock and has been saving up to buy a hotel. So, yeah.\n\nAnyhow, I wasn’t surprised when he came to me last month with an idea for a game. With excited eyes, he explained the mechanics of a math-based learning game and how he wanted to sell it on an app store.\n\nWe have a habit of discussing business ideas so it wasn’t until later that evening that I realized to myself, goshdarnit, we could actually do this— it’s kinda what I do for a living\n\nI thought I’d share how it went and some of the anecdotal observations I made along the way — skip to the end if you want to hear about our process.\n\nI’m guessing that thousands of years ago, the colors in our environment told us something about what was poisonous or delicious. And now, it seems, we’re naturally skilled at translating that to CSS.\n\nIn their CSS experimentation, the kids initially landed on the brightest candy-looking colors for things like buttons and inputs.\n\nWhen I explained to Owen that many folks might not be able to read rainbow-colored buttons, he argued that it was his game and he preferred the gradients.\n\nI eventually convinced him to switch by explaining more people could use the game with higher contrast labels (and thus, more money if we were charging)… I might add “using business metrics to influence a 9-year-old” to my resume!\n\nMy son designed his game first and then we went through the development process, finally demoing it to great applause from the family. Afterward, I sat down with my daughter and began the same exercise.\n\nBoth products turned out to be similarly named side-scrolling race games with multiple characters vying for a finish line based on how fast they could accomplish a specific learning-based task.\n\nAlthough the games share the same general format, the concepts are individually interesting with unique illustrations and narratives. Using the same general blueprint sped up our development cycle on the second game while still allowing us to deliver a new, engaging experience.\n\nMy daughter was influenced by what was, at that point in time, the status quo she was familiar with. This is great for incremental innovation but probably restrained her from truly leapfrogging the competition (her brother).",

    title = "‘Decision to Leave’ Review: A Labyrinth of Noir",
    content = "One of the many pleasures of the feverish “Decision to Leave” is that the director Park Chan-wook clearly had as much fun making the movie as you will have watching it. A heady, baroque mystery infused with the kind of old-fashioned romantic fatalism that makes noir-darkened hearts flutter, it is a story of impossible love — though even a determined admirer may wonder if it’s also impossible to get a handle on this sly, ingeniously slippery movie.\n\nNever fear, though, as someone once cautioned me about visiting Venice, you will get lost. But navigating a mystery’s enigmas, sifting through its clues and unlocking its secrets are what draw us to stories like this, and here, even if you find yourself at an apparent dead end, Park will guide you back on track. Both times that I’ve seen “Decision to Leave” I questioned whether the movie was overly addled or I was, both being possible. Who’s the lovelorn gangster, I wondered. What does this or that plot kink have to do with the mystery woman? And why does one detective keep thumping his partner with an electric massager?\n\nPark drops you into the movie so abruptly that you would be forgiven for thinking that you had missed the first 15 minutes (or a prequel). As the staccato of bullets fills the soundtrack, a flurry of rapidly deployed scenes zip by, and the movie jumps from two detectives shooting at an indoor firing range and chatting, and then working a case and talking some more. The opening draws you right in with its destabilizing jump cuts, controlled freneticism, narrative ellipses and oddball swerves — cut to a fog-wreathed discussion about insomnia — which creates an inviting ambiguity. It’s unclear what’s happening; it will remain unclear for a while.\n\nThere’s a dead body, of course, which soon materializes with the first glints of the main story. While hiking, a man has died under suspicious circumstances, leaving a broken watch and beautiful widow, Seo-rae (Tang Wei, wonderful), who’s called in for questioning by the two detectives. The lead investigator, the sleep-challenged Hae-joon (Park Hae-il), is instantly and conspicuously drawn to her. By contrast, the other detective, Soo-wan (Go Kyung-pyo), the guy with the electric massager, is more leery, harshly noting that she doesn’t seem especially upset by her husband’s death. Hae-joon replies that his wife wouldn’t be either, a revelatory comment about a man who proves more complicated than he appears.\n\nHae-joon puts Seo-rae under surveillance and before long, in classic old Hollywood detective fashion, he falls for her, hard. He trails and watches her, tracking her every move whether she’s at work (she’s a caregiver for older, housebound patients) or at home with her cat and droning TV. Sometimes, he imagines himself in Seo-rae’s apartment — you see him there, too — where he hovers near her, almost within kissing distance. And when she falls asleep sitting on her couch, eyes closed as a column of smoldering ash precariously droops from her cigarette, he also imagines himself holding an ashtray under its burning tip.\n\nSometimes a dying cigarette isn’t just a cigarette, but an intimation of later smolder and ash. While Hae-joon’s solicitousness toward Seo-rae can read as sweetly considerate (or stalker-ish), his investigation rapidly morphs into fascination and then life-changing, brain-fogging obsession. Under the cover of his detective work, he insinuates himself into Seo-rae’s life — or does she coax him in? — until they’re sharing rooms, meals and rainy walks. He loves her, but even as they grow close, he remains distrustful. From the start, he has decided who she is, putting her in a box, an idea that Park literalizes at one point with a shocking, gasp-inducing shot of her seated alone in the multiple square-shaped rooms of her apartment.\n\nOn the most elemental level, “Decision to Leave” is a classic detective story driven by Hae-joon’s desire for Seo-rae and by his desire (one shared by the viewer) to know who’s done it and why. But nothing is ever straightforward with Park, an exuberant, adventurous maximalist who likes to kink up narrative and delights in the plasticity of the medium. Here, he plays with time and space, blurs the past with the present and inventively employs flashbacks and fantasy sequences that deepen the mystery, disrupt the flow and draw attention to the filmmaking itself. The effect can be dazzling, and enjoyably dizzying.",

    title = "Edward Hopper’s Fantasy Island",
    content = "Edward Hopper’s New York,” the Whitney’s latest dive into its extensive Hopper holdings, sounds at first like the museum coasting on its hometown hero. Here is an occasion to trot out works like “Early Sunday Morning,” which makes a tidy Anytown of rowhouses along Seventh Avenue. But focus instead on that apostrophe in the title: This is Hopper’s New York, emphasis on the possessive, and for all its crowd-pleasing fare this is a more challenging show about his dominion over the city.\n\nIn paintings we know well and many we don’t, as well as some enlightening works on paper and writings, the artist long described as a Realist is recast as the architect of his own personal fantasy metropolis. He dispenses almost entirely with street life and traffic, ignores skyscrapers and the Brooklyn Bridge, and inserts imaginary buildings where it suits him; he peers in at private apartments from elevated trains and surveys his own neighborhood from rooftops. He turns offices, restaurants and movie theaters into stages for just one or two actors. He paints windows and storefronts without glass, as if he could just reach in and touch the people and things inside.\n\nIn one illuminating section of the exhibition, Hopper even tangles with the infamous urban planner Robert Moses over the transformation of Washington Square Park. For most of his life and career Hopper lived at 3 Washington Square North, and to judge from his correspondence with Moses and others he seems to have viewed the park as his own backyard. He first wrote an aggrieved letter to Moses in 1936 objecting to the condition of the lawns and to fencing that blocked the park’s greenery; later, fearing eviction by an expanding New York University, he sent him a second, more urgent missive and received a condescending response suggesting that he take up his concerns with the school chancellor.\n\nDisplayed near the letters are watercolors and works on paper made from Hopper’s rooftop, with Washington Square in the background. Air shafts, water towers and chimneys crowd these pictures, coming together to form a kind of substitute skyline — a private mini-city. Hopper’s identification with this view signals his personal stake in this place, laying claim not only to the space he rented within the building but also to all that he could see from this vantage point, the show’s curator Kim Conaty writes in her catalog essay.\n\nHe was fascinated by bridges, particularly the Queensboro (as it was known in Hopper’s day) and Manhattan Bridges that opened not long after his move to the city, as well as the already in use Williamsburg and Macombs Dam Bridges. He depicted their steel trusses and cantilevers, as well as the views from their spans: the grassy stretch of Blackwell’s Island (now Roosevelt Island), the tops of tenements peeking out over the Delancey Street ramp.",

I was 750 feet up the 5,600-foot dome of Chambe, a peak within the Mulanje Massif, in southern Malawi. On one of only a handful of rock climbs in the country, I felt like I was on another planet, my senses in overdrive. Behind me, low-slung clouds like clinging cobwebs blanketed green plains.\n\nMy fingers bit hard into a small edge of rock the width of a pencil, and I pushed the rubber of my shoes against little ripples in the stone. On a small ledge some 30 feet below me, my climbing partner, Matt McGeever, holding the other end of the blue nylon rope tied to my harness, shouted encouragement. Keeping my body from peeling off the wall and cheese-gratering down the rough slab took all my concentration.\n\nTo my eternal relief, the baboons didn’t come any closer.Two days earlier, I had flown with Matt into Chileka International Airport, in Blantyre, the second-largest city in Malawi, in southeastern Africa. Standing in line for passport control, I chatted with a group of older missionaries from Texas. When I told them I was here to rock climb, they were shocked. “I had no idea Malawi was a place people come to do that!” one of them said.\n\nAnd, well, Malawi hasn’t been, and it isn’t, exactly — yet. Most tourists come to Malawi to go on safaris among bulbous baobabs in Liwonde National Park or sunbathe on the sparkling yellow beaches of Lake Malawi, which stretches for two-thirds of the country’s length. But Malawi is also blessed with an abundance of rock. This thin sliver of a country, vaguely boomerang-shaped and roughly the size of Pennsylvania, is speckled with fine-grained granite domes soaring for thousands of feet; small steeper cliffs colored cantaloupe-orange; and innumerable boulder fields littered with house-size blocks — all of which could one day be a draw for more rock climbers like Matt and me.',

    content = 'What do you expect to find in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter? Unsurprisingly, asteroids — millions of bits of rocky debris — would be the correct answer. But recently, astronomers have found some oddball objects that appear to be misplaced hiding in the rubble: comets.\n\nNow, as reported last week in a study in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, a survey dedicated to hunting these misfits might have spied another icy individual blasting its own matter into space.\n\nScientists identified the suspected comet with the Wide Field Camera of the Isaac Newton Telescope on the Canary Island of La Palma. During three observation runs from 2018 through 2020, they watched 534 different asteroids, looking for signs of a comet’s coma — its ephemeral gassy shell — or tail made by the dust in the coma being pushed by the sun’s radiation.\n\nConventionally, comets are made of a nucleus, a solid core of various ices and dust. As a comet approaches the sun, its most volatile ices vaporize, creating a coma and two types of tails.Comets are thought to have originated from the fringes of the solar system and beyond. Unlike their frosty cousins that often linger in our star system’s cold outer reaches, asteroid belt, or main belt, comets stick to the warmer edge of the inner solar system. These comets are also as ancient as their neighboring asteroids, making their frozen matter mystifying.\n\n“We need to be able to explain how their ice survived for so long,” said Léa Ferellec, a postgraduate student of astronomy at the University of Edinburgh and an author of the study.Solving this will help to explain not just the planetary diversity and layout of the solar system, but also one of the greatest questions in astronomy: Where did Earth’s water come from?\n\nAstronomers suspect that at least some of Earth’s water came from a bombardment of comets flying in from afar. However, robotic reconnaissance missions and distant observations have demonstrated that their water’s chemical fingerprints often do not match the Earth’s. It is also easier for objects from the asteroid belt to crash into the planet.',
